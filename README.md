# Tell-me-a-joke
Getting bored, then please visit this project and have fun.
This programme is mostly based on javascript programing
i have saved an array of approx. 100 jokes in it and loading it in the document with random generator.
the form in the footer or we can say at last is only for you, to enter your joke and save it.{NOTE : THESE JOKES WILL ONLY BE SHOWN TO YOU.}
this form saves your entered jokes in your local storage with time.
But you might be thinking that where does it store the time => the answer is that, we all know local storage is an object, so it saves things in key:value pairs,
So, i had saved your jokes as a key and for every keyi have saved its value as its time of storing.
the link tag that you can see above this form is anchor tag => <a href = '_link_'></a>
it is link to a page that will show you jokes that you have saved.
THE PROCEDURE OF THIS SHOWING SAVED JOKES IS LIKE THIS:
=> it takes all keys of local storage with for loop and then for every key it takes it value.
=> and it shows both of them on screen with .innerHTML function of js.

THAT'S ALL OF HOW MY PROJECT WORKS.
I HOPE YOU WILL ENJOY IT A LOT.
THANK YOU.
